%% RECUPERER LE CODE
\section{Running the code}
The source code is available on
\href{https://git.sophia.mines-paristech.fr/aymeric.millan/visu-raytracing}{Mines' GitLab server}.
You can use the \code{environment.yml} file to setup your Python environment
with conda.

To run the app, just launch the \code{main.py} file and let the UI guide you !

%% STATE OF ART
\section{State of the art}

    Ray tracing was first introduced in 1980 by Turner Whitted in his paper on
\href{https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/Papers/p343-whitted.pdf}{An
Improved Illumination Model for Shaded Display}

Blabla why we used python, Blabla.

    %%%%%QT
    \subsection{User Interface : Qt Designer}

    We decided to use Qt (with either PySide or PyQt as a wrapper) for the User
interface, this way, we don't have to make complex documentation about what
keyboard shortcut to use to interact with ou VTK panel.

To build the UI we used \href{https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html}{Qt Designer},
which generated a \code{.ui} file. This file is compiled at the start of our
program into a \code{.py} file which is the corresponding Qt Windows, with all
sizes and objects' labels automatically set. We do not have to touch this file
once it is generated.This method allowed us to make a more complex UI to give
the user more interaction with our VTK environment.

%% CONCLUSION
\section*{Conclusions}

VTK c'est une usine à gaz. C'est fort quand meme on peut render nimporte ou avec
nimporte quel DIrectX, OpenGL, etc... Mais la portabilité a un cout : la complexité

Les bindings python sont efficaces

Peut être faire en C++ si cetait a refaire

Toujours plus d'améliorations possible, surtout au niveau e l'interface
(bouger les objets avec la souris, image de prérendu avant de save un png, etc...)

Amélioration : Séparer en plusieurs classes python propre au liieu d'un gros fichier
